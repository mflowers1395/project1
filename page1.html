  <p> In 2018, I tried to knit my very own homemade sweater.  Prior to this, I had been knitting for three years, but I never made anything more advanced than a scarf. I wanted to challenge myself.  However, I didn't want to make just any sweater, Therefore, I began my research on the types of sweaters out there. I found patterns such as Rib, Stockinette, Aran, and HoneyComb. Having high expectations for myself, I wanted to make the best sweater ever. Thus, leading my decision to make the Aran Sweater. Soon enough, my dream to make a sweater would become a reality. </p>
